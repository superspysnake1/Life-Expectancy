# Math 342 Life Expectancy Project
To serve as the capstone of my statistics series (WWU Math 341-342), I was assigned to write a paper on a multivariate regressional analysis that I would run on a dataset that I was interested in. I chose a large World Health Organization dataset which included 23 variables tracked for every country over 15 years (2000-2015). After exploring and cleaning the dataset, I developed 5 questions that I would test. I used R to calculate regressions, ANOVA tables, and generate figures. Final writeup is written using LaTeX.
